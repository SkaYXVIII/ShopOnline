My first application using spring boot. It's simple app for training purpose.
So far I only implemented beckend logic of app,that relies on showing items from database,updating their specification, deleting them,adding them to database and also connecting them in grups. I read endpoints through Postman app. My entire website is created on http://localhost:8080.

List of Endpoints:
[GET]
/items
/items/{id}
/groups
/groups/{id}
[POST]
/items
[PUT]
/items/{id}
[DELETE]
/items/{id}

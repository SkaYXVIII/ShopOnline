My first CRUD application using spring boot. It's simple app for training purpose.
So far implemented backend logic of app,that relies on showing items from database,
updating their specification, deleting them, adding them to database and also connecting them in groups.
I read endpoints through Postman app.

## List of Endpoints:
### [GET]
- /items
- /items/{id}
- /groups
- /groups/{id}
### [POST]
- /items
### [PUT]
- /items/{id}
### [DELETE]
- /items/{id}

## Examples of reading some endpoints type GET:
